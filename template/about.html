      <h1>About Eden</h1>

      <p>Eden is a healthy restaurant located in Pittsburgh's shadyside neighborhood at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=735+Copeland+St.+Pittsburgh%2C+Pa+15232&data=!1m4!1m3!1d3230!2d-79.9345744!3d40.4511665!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x8834f210e0181241%3A0x8f971a55e1378d7!3m8!1m3!1d97183!2d-79.9805004!3d40.4313684!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1">385 Copeland street</a>. Chef and co-owner <strong>Hilary Zozula</strong> created Eden with no agenda or diet in mind. She took to raw cuisine for the health benefits and getting the most nutrient value out of the ingredients. She learned that not only is eating this way good for you, but it can taste amazing. This is essentially the reason we open our doors everyday. To give you a delicious and healthy experience.</p>

      <blockquote>"If the servers are unhappy, customers will know. And if the kitchen staff is underpaid and overtired, you'll be able to taste it."</blockquote>

      <p>Eden treats their employees fairly. This <a href="http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/local-eatery-eden-joins-a-new-campaign-to-improve-the-lot-of-restaurant-workers/Content?oid=1730922">City Paper Article</a> brought this to light. We stand firmly behind the Restaurants Advancing Industry Standards in Employment campaign. It's not complicated for us. Happy employees make better food. 
      </p>

      <p>If you're wondering about the crowd or attire it can be quite eclectic. Giving the nature of our cuisine we appeal to a diverse collection. Just be yourself. Relax and enjoy the meal and our environment.</p>
